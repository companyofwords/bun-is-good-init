# Bun is good isn't it?

I am not very good at sharing my code, despite being an extrovert! It has more to do with working for years in corporate where they would look at you funny if you even suggested sharing with a developer community (quite apart from violating regulatory bodies etc...)

# Or More specifically Elysia with Bun is really good isn't it?

Anyhow, here are some initial experiments at using Bun JS - a recent alternative to Node JS to do some of the things I have needed Node JS to do in the past...

Elysia appears to be the most highly rated and fastest alternative to Express

## Just the way my grandpappy (or elderly Node JS developer colleagues) did it

...tumble weed tumble weed...Bun is still as of writing on version 1 - so will very much evolve...but here I have started to translate over... Currently this is very experimental as we find our way so bear with me.

## Getting Started / Basics Info

## Development

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8889/ to see the results.
