# Bun is good isn't it? (EXPERIMENTAL)

1, 2. 1, 2. This is a test!

Ready for a big new project, I have been creating an API and CRUD app using Bun.js and Elysia.js - using tools and patterns from Node.js and Express.

I want to see whether Bun.js and Elysia.js are as good and stand up

# Or More specifically Elysia with Bun is really good isn't it?

Bun.js is the much-vaunted like-for-like Node.js alternative. Elysia is the most highly rated and proven fastest alternative to Express.

I have been following along with the following doc pages

You can find out more about Bun.js at [https://bun.sh/docs](https://bun.sh/docs) or Elysia.js on [https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html](https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html).

Note - Bun.js is still as of writing on version 1 - so will very much evolve...so this code may change too.

## Getting Started / Basics Info

## Development

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Test
