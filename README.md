# Bun.js is good isn't it? (Initial API baking experiments)

1, 2. 1, 2. This is a test!

Ready for a big new project, I have been creating an API and CRUD app using Bun.js and Elysia.js - using tools and patterns from Node.js and Express.

I want to see whether Bun.js and Elysia.js are as good and stand up as the old stuff...

Here are the docs: http://localhost:8889/docs.

## Or More specifically Elysia.js with Bun.js is really good isn't it?

Bun.js is the much-vaunted like-for-like Node.js alternative (seen also as a Swiss Army knife for developers with lots of extras - testing, managing packages and bundling obviously). Elysia is the most highly rated and proven fastest alternative to Express.

Bun.js should really be called Bun.ts because it uses TYPESCRIPT out of the box!

I have been following along with these doc pages

You can find out more about Bun.js at [https://bun.sh/docs](https://bun.sh/docs) or Elysia.js on [https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html](https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html).

Note - Bun.js is still as of writing on version 1 - so will very much evolve...so this code may change too.

## Getting Started / Basics Info

### Development

To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8889/ to see the results.

### Test

To run test:

```bash
bun run test
```

## Experiments

### Documentation (using Swagger)

### Testing

Using Bun JS testing suite

### Elysia and Bun JS docs

Please refer to (Bun Docs) https://bun.sh/docs

(Elysia Docs) https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html

## Objectives (Personal)

- handlers and context - body, query, params, store, set . status / headers / redirect

- explore bun testing
- use html
- using sqlite db (using Drizzle ORM later)
- use typescript
- use env variables
- use routers / controllers
- understand the context handler - res req
- understand guards / hooks
- understand middleware, hooks, auths
- OnResponse, OnError
- Streams / Blobs
- file io API / generate txt - make some ascii art - https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet / https://devhints.io/figlet
- Websockets
- use swagger
- use CORS
- use logger
- use Helmet

Done:


# Learningz (Personal)

- '' - a second apostrophe let's you keep an apostrophe in JSON body for sqlite
- updating autoincrement to 666 is hard
